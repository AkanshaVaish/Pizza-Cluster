Project Proposal
 
Project Overview:
Pizza Cluster is a brand-new way of ordering pizza online. It completely eliminates the inconvenience of finding a nearby pizza shop and the hustle to place the order over the phone. The online web application, on which the project is based on, will allow the user to signup and create his own account. The user can then select a pizza place of his own choice and customize a pizza as per his/her preference. It will also allow the user to check the status of his/her order and track the delivery process in real-time.
 
Current method and problems related to it:
Currently all orders are either taken on phone or in stores. Taking orders on phone particularly is very ineffective as usually the customers are “rushed” by the staff to place the order and often they don’t end up getting what they initially thought of. Also, extra employees are needed to take the order over the phone which lengthens the process and increases the possibility of human error.
 
Further Analysis:
Ordering pizza online using Pizza Cluster would certainly improve the overall experience of the customer as customer would have more time to consider different options and user-friendly interface would help the user to see the end product before finalizing it. The main features of the web application would be following:
-          User information:
o   Login Credentials
o   Order history of the user and based on that the user will get future suggestions.
o   Reward-Points. For every purchase user will get points which he/she can redeem on the next purchase.
-          Interactive Ordering Process:
o   User will be able to select from large variety of options.
o   User will be able to see the feedback of other customers about a certain type of bread or topping and based on that he can select his options.
o   User will be assisted with interactive interface where he would be able to see the final pizza before finalizing it.
o   Easy Payment option (Debit/Credit).
-          Real Time Tracking:
o   User can check the status of his order in real time.
o   User would be able to track the delivery person using Google maps
